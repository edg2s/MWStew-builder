# MWStew-builder: A backend PHP for building MediaWiki extension files

## Development
This tool is fairly stable, but is currently going through QA and testing, and is continuously developed. Please report any bugs you encounter!

**Feel free to contribute!**

## Install
If you want to use this tool, make sure to:
